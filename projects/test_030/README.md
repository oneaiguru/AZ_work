# test_030

Simple HTML page that lets you choose a folder of Markdown files,
shows the folder path and lists up to the first ten file names.
A debug checkbox limits processing to a single file and logs
detailed operations to the console.

## Features
- Choose a directory containing Markdown files.
- Display the selected folder in the page.
- List first ten `.md` files (or one in debug mode).
- Debug mode logs each operation and result.

## Usage
1. Open `index.html` in a modern browser.
2. Optionally enable **Debug** to log operations and only process one file.
3. Use the folder picker to select a directory of Markdown documents. The file names will appear in the list.
